      <p>My name is Andrew, and I am a current student at Code Fellows. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and I often need information that I cannot access due to lack of cellular data service. The desire to get that information via text message was the genesis of this project idea. </p>

      <p>I came to software development from the financial services world.  I'm really drawn to the idea of working in an industry where fixing problems is expected rather than "someone else's problem."</p>

      <p>My name is Michael George. I am a father, fianc√©, photographer and JavaScript developer. As a photographer, I often find myself in low-service areas and am in need of current information. The need to conquer this dichotomy caught my interest for this project.</p>
