      <p>My name is Andrew, and I am a current student at Code Fellows. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and I often need information that I cannot access due to lack of cellular data service. The desire to get that information via text message was the genesis of this project idea. </p>

      <p>My name is Adam, and I came to software development from the financial services world.  I really like the idea of working in an industry where fixing problems is expected rather than "someone else's problem."  I was drawn to this project because of the real world usefulness of receiving text info where internet is not available.  That and my uncanny ability to got lost while exploring in the woods.</p>

      <p>My name is Michael George. I am a father, fianc√©, photographer and JavaScript developer. As a photographer, I often find myself in low-service areas and am in need of current information. The need to conquer this dichotomy caught my interest for this project.</p>
